                    I'm currently in the second year of my computer science degree at CU Boulder. Here are some of the classes I've taken: &darr;

                    <p style="font-size:1rem;">
                        Learned about and implemented software development cycles including agile while working on Visify (my group's final project). In this class, I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                    <p>
                        Introduced to the fundamental concepts of robotics including kinematics, mapping, and planning. Final project was a grocery shopper robot coded in Python, in Webots (robot simulation), which could pick up and put objects into a basket.

                        Discovered various algos that operate on data structures taught in 2270. Most of the class content was theoretical and involved proving, finding the runtime of, and looking at implementations of algos.

                    <p>
                        Class involved writing implementations in C++ for popular data structures such as stacks, hash maps, and linked lists.

                        Low level class where I learned the details of how a computer executes instructions, allocates memory, etc. Lab assignments had us create a dynamic memory allocator, a shell, and much more.
