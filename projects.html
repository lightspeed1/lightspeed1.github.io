                        I made this from complete scratch over the course of a few months (around Aug 2022 - Feb 2023). This is a game where the player can build with three kinds of parts: cubes, slants (cube cut diagonally), and cylinders. The player can resize, move, copy, delete, and save their parts. An especially fun feature to implement was explosions. The player can explode their builds and watch everything blow apart in real time. To do this, I had to make sure parts could collide with eachother (I had to figure out collision detection and make a physics engine from scratch). More detail on my
